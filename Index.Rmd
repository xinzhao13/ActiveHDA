London is a resourceful city in terms of physical activities. You can find:

* At least a dozen parks
* Parkour parks
* Dancing schools
* Salsa bars
* Climbing walls
* Kickboxing clubs
* Any sports clubs you can think of
* Casual walks within 100km of the city

While we can do most things alone, there is something different about exercise that is a lot more fun with a crowd (eg. dancing like a group of monkeys). Plus since our Masters' is so intensive, I do think it's important to have a distraction through any of baking, cooking, puzzle solving, board games, video games, walking, cycling, running, alcohol or reading.

Here I will start from running. It might be the most popular go-to relaxation-slash-exercise activity, which I presume a significant proportion of our MSc HDA cohort is doing. A secondary benefit of running is that it is somehow "productive" alongside the health aspect.
